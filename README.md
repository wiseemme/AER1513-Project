# AER1513-Project

Example of RB-PHD-SLAM from M. Adams, B. Vo, R. Mahler and J. Mullane, "SLAM Gets a PHD: New Concepts in Map Estimation," in IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 26-37, June 2014.
Included are:
- A base FastSLAM algorithm
- A MHTFastSLAM algorithm
- RB-PHD-SLAM algorithm 

The FastSLAM algorithm build off of the FastSLAM framework from: http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws13/mapping/exercise/fastslam_framework.tar.gz
